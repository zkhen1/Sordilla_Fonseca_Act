# 📚 Library Reservation System

A web-based application built with Laravel to streamline library book and space reservations. Developed as part of a Midterm Examination, it enables students and faculty to check availability, make reservations, and manage resources through an intuitive interface.

## 📝 Description / Overview

**LibraryReservation** is a web-based application developed as part of our Midterm Examination.  
The system aims to streamline the process of reserving books and study spaces in the library.  
It allows students and faculty to conveniently check book availability, make reservations, and manage library resources through an intuitive interface.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To design and develop a functional **library reservation system**.  
- To apply CRUD operations in managing library resources and reservations.  
- To implement **user authentication and role management** (e.g., Admin and Student).  
- To practice database integration and relational table design.  
- To enhance understanding of web system workflows using Laravel.

## ⚙️ Features / Functionality

- **User Registration and Login** — Secure authentication for library users and administrators.  
- **Book Management** — Add, edit, delete, and view available books.  
- **Reservation System** — Users can reserve books or library rooms.  
- **Search Functionality** — Quickly find books by title, author, or category.  
- **Reservation History** — View current and past reservations.  
- **Admin Dashboard** — Manage users, books, and reservations in one place.  
- **Database Integration** using **MySQL**.  
- **Theme Switcher** — Toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode for better visibility.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Laravel (PHP)  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Blade templates)  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Composer, XAMPP (for local MySQL setup)

## 💻 Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally. Ensure you have **Composer** and **XAMPP** (or a similar MySQL setup) installed.

### Prerequisites
- PHP (version 8.0 or higher)  
- Composer  
- XAMPP (for MySQL database)  
- A web browser

### Steps
1. **Download or Clone the Project**  
   - Download the ZIP file or clone the repository:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sordillaanne/Fonseca_Sordilla_Act
     ```

2. **Move the Project Folder**  
   - Extract or copy the project folder into the `htdocs` directory of your **XAMPP** installation.  
     Example path:  
     ```
     C:\xampp\htdocs\LibraryReservation
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run:  
     ```bash
     composer install
     ```

4. **Start XAMPP Services**  
   - Open the **XAMPP Control Panel**.  
   - Start **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.

5. **Set Up the Database**  
   - Open your browser and go to:  
     ```
     http://localhost/phpmyadmin
     ```
   - Create a new database named:  
     ```
     LibraryReservation
     ```
   - Import the provided SQL file (e.g., `LibraryReservation.sql`) into this database.

6. **Configure Database Connection**  
   - Open the project’s `.env` file (or `config/database.php`).  
   - Ensure the database settings match your local environment:  
     ```php
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=LibraryReservation
     DB_USERNAME=root
     DB_PASSWORD=
     ```

7. **Run Migrations (Optional)**  
   - If using Laravel migrations instead of the SQL file, run:  
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     ```

8. **Run the Project**  
   - In your terminal, start the Laravel development server:  
     ```bash
     php artisan serve
     ```
   - Open your web browser and navigate to:  
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard
     ```
   - The system’s dashboard should now be accessible.
